## Twelve Snakes
Twelve Snakes is a 12-player text-mode Snake clone for the Sega Saturn. Requires a modded Saturn or another method to get code running. Build the code with joengine or grab an ISO from [releases](https://github.com/slinga-homebrew/Twelve-Snakes/releases).

The resolution of the game has been changed to support wide screen televisions:
- Use the zoom feature (not 16:9) in your television
- The top text and the bottom empty space will be cut off but the game area will take up the entire TV
- The aspect ratio looks correct

### Player One Special Commands
Only player one can:
- pause/display the score with the Start button
- speedup/slowdown the game with the Left and Right Shoulder buttons
- clear scores with the Z button
